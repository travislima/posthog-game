# 🦔 HogSnake - The Ultimate Data-Driven Snake Game 

(https://travislima.github.io/posthog-game/)


Welcome to HogSnake, where PostHog's beloved hedgehog mascot slithers through the digital realm, collecting precious data points and growing stronger with every analytics insight!
🎮 What's This All About?
Ever wondered what would happen if you crossed the classic Snake game with PostHog's signature style? Wonder no more! Our spiky friend has traded in product analytics for good old-fashioned arcade action, but kept that iconic orange glow we all know and love.

🧡 PostHog's Signature Orange: Because branding matters, even in retro gaming
📊 Data Point Collection: Gather glowing orange analytics orbs (they're totally not just food)
🌟 Glassmorphism UI: Modern, blurred backgrounds that scream "we know good design"
📈 Progressive Difficulty: The more data you collect, the faster things get (just like real analytics!)
🏆 High Score Tracking: Your achievements persist, unlike your browser cookies
🎹 Smooth Controls: WASD or arrow keys - we're inclusive like that

🛠 Technical Stack

Pure HTML5 - No frameworks, no dependencies, no drama
Canvas API - For that smooth, buttery gameplay
CSS3 Gradients - Because flat design is so 2010
LocalStorage - Your high scores stick around (unlike that one coworker)
Google Fonts (Inter) - Typography that means business

🎨 Design Philosophy
We took PostHog's design DNA and injected it straight into the 80s arcade scene:

Dark themes for those late-night analytics sessions
Orange accents that pop like conversion rate notifications
Smooth animations because life's too short for janky UIs
Clean typography that your design system would approve of
Subtle glassmorphism because we're not animals

🔧 Customization Ideas
Want to make it your own? Here are some fun mods:

🎵 Add sound effects when collecting data points
🌈 Different colored food for different types of analytics
🏅 Achievement system for various milestones
👥 Multiplayer mode (because teamwork makes the dream work)
📱 Mobile controls for on-the-go data collection
🎨 Seasonal themes (Halloween hedgehog, anyone?)
